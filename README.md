# Ruby Data Class Types Lab

Here, you will be working on the array methods mentioned in the[Ruby Arrays](https://dev.to/bmweygant/ruby-arrays-o8n) lesson.

In this lab you will write several methods to familiarize yourself with some common Array methods.

Since there are many tests in this lab, I suggest using the `--f-f` flag (fail fast) when using `rspec` to only show to first failed test. `rspec --f-f`
